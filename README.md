# Animal Behavior for *The Long Dark*

This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studio, Inc.

It includes [TweakRabbits](https://github.com/ds5678/TweakRabbits) and [DetectionRange](https://github.com/ds5678/DetectionRange) ported by [ds5678](https://github.com/ds5678) and originally made by [AlexTheRegent](https://github.com/AlexTheRegent).
**Special thanks** to them for all their contributions!

## Description

The default animal behavior were to easy in my opinion and not really challenging. Especially rabbits needed a lot of tweaking. Besides adding new options, like a fleeing duration, I also wanted to improve [DetectionRange](https://github.com/ds5678/DetectionRange). Instead of having multiple animal behavior mods, with the permission of [ds5678](https://github.com/ds5678) I decided to include all animal mods polished into this one.

## Settings

There are new settings in the *Mod Options*:

- Rabbits
  - Stun Duration Modifier
